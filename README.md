# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction – Machine Learning App  

**Predict flight ticket prices based on travel details using Machine Learning.**  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data science pipeline** – from **EDA and feature engineering** to **model building and deployment** with Streamlit.  

---

## ✅ Project Overview
The airline industry is highly dynamic, and pricing varies based on multiple factors such as airline, route, stops, and travel date. This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict flight prices, helping businesses and customers make better decisions.  

**Key Highlights:**  
✔ Built using **Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit**  
✔ Includes **EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Training, and Deployment**  
✔ Interactive **web application** for real-time predictions  

---

## 📊 Key Insights from Data
- **Duration and Airline Type** are the most significant factors affecting price.  
- Flights in **peak months** (March, May, June) show a **price surge of up to 35%** compared to off-peak months.  
- **Business Class (Jet Airways Business)** is the most expensive category, with prices 4–5x economy.  
- Flights with multiple stops are often **long-haul and expensive** in this dataset (18+ hours).
